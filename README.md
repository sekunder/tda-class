We covered the preliminaries for this course at a high level. Vector spaces and linear maps, topological spaces and continuous maps.

We introduced the standard $n$-simplex $\Delta_n = \\{(t_0,t_1,\dots,t_n) : \sum_{i=0}^n = 1, t_i \geq 0 \forall i\\}$ as model of $n$-dimensional space. In particular, as long as we follow certain "gluing rules" we can build many topological spaces out of simplices. Finally, we introduced the chain group of a simplicial complex as a way to encode the topological/geometrical idea of a cycle via linear algebra. We used the example from the start of Chapter 2 of Hatcher[1], using vector spaces instead of free groups.
